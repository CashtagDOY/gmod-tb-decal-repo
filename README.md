# Garry's Mod Trainbuild Decal Repository
A public repository for everyone's decals, real or fictional.

# Rules for PRing decals
> Your image MUST be less than 4096x4096 (you seriously shouldn't need anything above 1024x1024).
> Exceptions may be made for long/wide decals, e.g. 256x4096.

> Railroad folders MUST be the railroad's reporting mark, real or fictional.

> Any new folders for fictional entities MUST be prefixed with "f_". (e.g. "f_lpsx") 

> Your VMT and VTF MUST be in the same spot and placed in the respective location (real or fictional).

> Keep it PG
