# Garry's Mod Trainbuild Decal Repository
A public repository for everyone's decals, real or fictional.

# Rules for PRing decals
> Your image MUST be less than 4096x4096 (you seriously shouldn't need anything above 1024x1024).
> Exceptions may be made for long/wide decals, e.g. 256x4096 but this is unlikely.

> Railroad folders MUST be the railroad's reporting mark, real or fictional.

> Any new folders for fictional entities MUST be prefixed with "f_". (e.g. "f_lpsx") 

> Your VMT and VTF MUST be in the same spot and placed in the respective location (real or fictional).

> Keep it PG

# Good etiquette for textures
> Set "Normal Format" to DXT1 and "Alpha Format" to DXT3 unless you REALLY need full alpha (you shouldn't).

> Most decals don't need to be over 1024x1024.

> Your decal should to to the EDGES of the texture (as much as proportionally possible).

> Individual letters/numbers should not exceed 512x512
